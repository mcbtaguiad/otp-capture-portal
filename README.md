## What's new?
Strictly set the deployment to Docker. Added an admin page that shows newly generated OTP - code and QR for easy input. I also added background and logo which can be dynamically change (docker mount) - this will be helpful for deployment for multiple client. 

## How it works
Upon connecting to the guest WLAN, nodogsplash flags the client as requiring authentication and redirects it to the captive portal, which prompts for a one-time access code.

The OTP is generated via Google Authenticator and validated against the server using the google-authenticator service and an custom PAM module.

After successful OTP verification, the portal signals nodogsplash to authorize the client, and network access is granted.

## Installation
### Router
#### OpenWrt/Nodogsplash
I assume that you have already installed OpenWrt on your router.

Refresh package list on OpenWrt. 
```bash
opkg update
```
Install nodogsplash
```bash
opkg install nodogsplash
```
Configure nodogsplash config. I'll be deploying this in a public cloud so the port is 443 and it's in https, if server is in your local network then change to http and 8000 (depending on you port-forwarding config). Look for line below and edit:
*etc/config/nodogsplash*
```
list preauthenticated_users 'allow tcp port 443 to <Server_IP>
```
*/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html*
```
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='https://<Server_IP>:443/index.html?authaction=$authaction&amp;tok=$tok&amp;redir=$redir&amp;mac=$clientmac&amp;ip=$clientip&amp;gatewayname=$gatewayname'" />
```
Enable and start nodogsplash service.
```bash
/etc/init.d/nodogsplash enable
/etc/init.d/nodogsplash start
```
### Server
#### Google Authenticator
Installed package if not yet installed. 
```bash
apt install libpam-google-authenticator
```
Generate your google authenticator config. Download authenticator app like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&pli=1), scan the QR generated to link it to the app. 
```bash
google-authenticator -t
```
#### Docker
Create a directory for the config and images. Google authenticor config is located in `/home/yourusername/.google_authenticator`. Mount it in docker compose.
```bash
mkdir data
tree -a data
.
├── background.jpeg
├── favicon.ico
├── .google_authenticator
└── logo.webp
```
*compose.yaml*
```yaml
services:
    otp-capture-portal:
        container_name: otp-capture-portal
        image: ghcr.io/mcbtaguiad/otp-capture-portal:main
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "8000:8000"
        environment:
            - BUSINESS_NAME=Swamp Coffee
            - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
            - ADMIN_PASSWORD=password123
        volumes:
            - ./data:/otpspot/data
```
Deploy
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
### Demo
Visit this [link](https://swampcoffee.marktaguiad.dev/). Add */admin* to view admin page, use **admin** and **password123** to login. If successfully logged in it will automatically redirect to OTP generator page.
